//Write a program that ggicen a number, 
//can find the sum of all the multiples of partifular numbers but
//not including that number

// P: Inputs :
//      the end number
//      the multiples that are being evaluated, in this case 3 and 5
//    Outputs: 
//      an array of the muliples that fulfill the divisible by 3 and 5 rule
//      a sum of those multiples
//    Rules: 
//      There can be no duplicates
//      The target number isn't included
//      only natural numbers
//      if no multiples are given, default to 3 and 5


//Examples and Test Cases : 
// 20 is the target || 3,5 are the multiples
//15 is the target  || 5 is the multiple
// 25 is the target || There are no given multiples
// 1 is the target  || 3 is your multiple
