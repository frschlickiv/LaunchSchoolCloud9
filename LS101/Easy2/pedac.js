//Suppose you have an arbitrary natural number (the target) and a set of one or more additional natural numbers (the factors). 
//Write a program that computes the sum of all numbers from 1 up to the target number that are also multiples of one of the factors. 
//For instance, if the target is 20, and the factors are 3 and 5, that gives us the list of multiples 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18.
//The sum of these multiples is 78.
//If no factors are given, use 3 and 5 as the default factors.


/*inputs:
  target number
  the set of factors
output:
  sum of multiples*/
